arduino-templates-gaf
=====================
arduino-templates-gaf is a collection of resources schematics, and footprints for working with arduinos, arduino variants and their shields with geda/gaf and PCB for geda.  

Let's see where this goes and start with a shield for the the Arduino Mega 2560 

Resources 
---------
* TIF image export from Arduino's EagleCAD design files for the Arduino Mega 2560 
* ppm for use with gaf's pcb software:  use the --bg-image switch to load it up
with your similarly scaled pcbs
* arduino-dimensions by johnengineer J.M. DeChristofaro, used for sanity
checking
